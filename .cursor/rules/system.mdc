System Architecture and Agent Roles
Our system consists of multiple specialized AI agents collaborating to drive the social media strategy. Each agent has a distinct role, and together they function as an “AI marketing team.” Leveraging a multi-agent design ensures tasks are handled by experts in each domain​

. The primary agents and their responsibilities are:
TrendScannerAgent: Monitors Twitter/X, Instagram, and LinkedIn for trending topics, hashtags, and content formats. It outputs timely insights (e.g. popular hashtags or memes in our niche) that inform content creation.
ContentCreatorAgent: Uses generative AI (e.g. OpenAI GPT-4 for text, Stable Diffusion or Midjourney for images) to produce engaging posts. It tailors the tone and format for each platform and follows predefined brand guidelines (supplied as JSON templates).
SchedulerAgent: Determines the optimal posting schedule for each platform and automates the publishing via platform APIs. It ensures posts go out at high-engagement times and logs all actions, caching API responses (like trend data) to reuse when appropriate.
Other supporting components could include an AnalyticsAgent (to analyze performance metrics and refine strategy) or an EngagementAgent (to handle replies and community interaction), as seen in similar multi-agent setups​

. A Coordinator or orchestrator process is also needed to facilitate data flow between agents (or one agent could take on a coordinator role). The table below summarizes the core agents:
Agent	Role	Key Functions	APIs/Tools Used
TrendScannerAgent	Trend monitoring on Twitter, IG, LinkedIn	- Fetch trending hashtags/topics on each platform
- Identify popular content formats (e.g. memes, short videos)
- Cache recent trends to avoid redundant API calls	Twitter API (trending topics)​

Each agent can be implemented as an AI-powered service with its own .mdc configuration file defining its behavior. We will now dive into each agent’s design and prompt, followed by the integration strategy and API best practices.
